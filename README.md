# Intro-to-Tidyverse
Materials and data sets for introductory workshop on tidyverse syntax

Welcome to the _Intro to Tidyverse_ mini-workshop GitHub page. You can find the workshop code and dataset in this repository. 

You may access the code in one of two ways: 
1) Simply copy and paste the code in Intro-to-Tidyverse-code.Rmd into a markdown document of your own (please do not copy into an R script). 

2) Fork this repository to your own GitHub and create a local copy. For more information on how to fork and clone a repo, refer to instructions by @aallyn [here](https://github.com/LGCarlson/Lab-Management/blob/master/WeeklyMeetingsInstructions.md). 

You may also view the knitted code on [RPubs}(http://rpubs.com/lgcarlson/tidyverseminiworkshop). 

I did not include the code for installing packages, so please make sure all necessary packages are downloaded before we begin.
